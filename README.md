## Introduction

Check [Introduction file] to read full version. This is summary.

[Autonomous Digital Companion] is a research project generalized by [KETI] (Korea Electronics Technnology Institute), supported by the [IITP] (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion) grant funded by the [Ministry of Science and ICT] (MSIT, a ministry of the Government of South Korea). This is a fundamental study for designing companions who provide the help you need for daily life. They also help you manage a better life and they respond to you out of sympathy because they understand your thoughts and intentions.

<b>[CESLeA]</b> is the third detailed project of Autonomous Digital Companion. It is an intelligent interaction technology research and development project that analyzes multi-modal data with AI learning techniques to grasp environment and user's state. It also interprets it with context-aware information including contextual understanding.

<b>[CESLeA.ISSubsystem]</b> is intergrated speech subsystem for [CESLeA] project developed by the 1st team in CESLeA project. This team is researching about autonomous intelligence Based on AI learning.
This module consists of speaker recognition, voice detection and voice controller.
